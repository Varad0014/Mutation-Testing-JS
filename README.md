# Mutation-Testing
## Overview
We conducted Mutation Testing on our source code in javascript which consists of data structures and algorithms. To conduct unit testing on the codebase, we opted for open-source frameworksâ€”Mocha, a testing library, and Chai, an assertions library. For Mutation Testing, we employed Stryker, a mutation testing tool that automatically mutates the source code. The detailed mutation testing report generated by Stryker also aids in test case design.

## Steps to execute tests
- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Varad0014/Mutation-Testing-JS.git`
- Make sure you have stryker installed globally
- Go to the root directory and install node packages: `npm install`
- Run mutation tests: `stryker run`
